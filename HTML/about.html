                    action by retailers, food service providers and consumers.Food is wasted in many ways</p>
                <p>Fresh produce that deviates from what is considered optimal. for example in terms Of shape, size and
                    color. is often removed from the supply chain during sorting operations.</p>
                <p>Large quantities of wholesome edible food are often unused or left over and discarded from household
                    kitchens and eating establishments</p>
